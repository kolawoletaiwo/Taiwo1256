Software engineering Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software, 
a field of computer science that bridges the gap between computer science and computer programming. It aims to improve the quality, 
maintainability, and effectiveness of software while reducing the cost, effort, and time spent in its development. Software engineering involves the design, 
development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software systems  Software engineering is a systematic and disciplined approach to developing high-quality, 
reliable, and maintainable software. It involves the application of engineering principles to the development of software systems. Differences from Traditional Programming 
â€¢	Focus on Process: Software engineering emphasizes a structured process for software development, known as the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This process defines a sequence of steps and activities that provide a framework for develop.
